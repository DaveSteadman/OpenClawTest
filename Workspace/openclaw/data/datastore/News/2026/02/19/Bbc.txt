  It is highly unlikely that the police arrested Andrew on Thursday on the basis of just a couple of emails people have seen within the Epstein files. At this stage, Andrew has only been arrested. He has not been charged. He has always denied any wrongdoing arising from his relationship with Epstein and has not responded to specific BBC questions about the files released in January. And a reminder, this arrest has nothing to do with allegations Andrew has previously faced from Giuffre, who said she was made to have sex with Andrew on a number of occasions in the early 2000s. An out-of-court financial settlement was reached between Andrew and Giuffre in 2022, which made no admission of wrongdoing on Andrew's part. The police released Andrew under investigation on Thursday evening. Typically with arrests relating to white collar crime, people are held for a few hours to allow for searches and initial questioning. Being released under investigation does not rule out further questioning at a later date. Now detectives will have a big decision to make. This could take weeks. Police officers with a crown on their cap badges will sit down with lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service

  Earlier, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor had become the first senior member of the Royal Family in modern history to have been arrested. It was another catch your breath moment. It was followed by an unprecedented statement from his brother, King Charles. "Let me state clearly: the law must take its course," read the unambiguous statement from the King, offering no hiding place or royal get-out clause. The arrest, on suspicion of misconduct in public office, relates to Andrew's time as the UK's trade representative between 2001 and 2011. It follows a series of allegations, prompted by the release of the Epstein files, that Andrew shared official documents. That included sharing reports from trade visits and a confidential briefing on investment in Afghanistan with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and passing a Treasury briefing to a personal business contact. Being a member of the Royal Family will make no legal difference to how his case is assessed. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has consistently denied any wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein. The no-nonsense police statement on Thursday morning was a bluntly worded news earthquake: "The man remains in police custody at this time." Whoever thought we'd read that sentence when the man in question is

  "As part of the investigation, we have today (19/2) arrested a man in his sixties from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office and are carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk. "The man remains in police custody at this time. "We will not be naming the arrested man, as per national guidance. Please also remember that this case is now active so care should be taken with any publication to avoid being in contempt of court. "Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said: "Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office. "'It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence. "We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.'"

  Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested at about 08:00 GMT on Thursday on the King's Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, where he has been staying. Officers arrested the King's brother on his 66th birthday. It is understood that neither the King nor Buckingham Palace was informed in advance of Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest, by officers from Thames Valley Police. We don't know the specifics of the allegations of misconduct in public office being investigated. However, previously reported allegations include that he had shared reports from trade visits, forwarded a confidential briefing on investment in Afghanistan, and passed a Treasury briefing to a personal business contact. BBC News UK and home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said: "There has to be an assumption that part of this is going to be the sharing of documents within the Epstein files - between Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein himself. That's when Thames Valley Police got involved." But Sandford said it was possible that police were not only focusing on emails seen widely in the Epstein files. "Firstly, there's three million documents in the files, so there may be some the media have missed. But secondly, Buckingham Palace said they would support Thames Valley Police in their inquiries. "And that potentially means

  When the police visited Ashley Warren's home in Jaywick, Essex, he told them his XL bully dogs were misunderstood, even suggesting they were less vicious than a poodle. Yet 10 days later, and two days after their ownership became illegal without a certificate of exemption , they mauled his mother-in-law to death. Esther Martin, 68, had been left in the property with the two dogs, eight puppies and a child while Warren filmed a music video in London on 3 February 2024. The amateur rapper was alerted to screams coming from his property in Hillman Avenue and demanded "someone that's strong, really strong" went immediately. But it was too late. Martin suffered "dozens and dozens" of catastrophic bites and was dead within minutes . Warren, 41, was arrested upon his return to Clacton railway station and became the first person in the UK to be charged with XL bully-related offences. He has now been found guilty of owning one of the dogs, called Bear, responsible for killing Martin. He was cleared of being in charge of the other dog, Beauty, which also injured Martin, but belonged to his girlfriend.
