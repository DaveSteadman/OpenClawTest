## 1. Introduction

BAE Systems plc remains one of the world’s leading defence, aerospace and security companies, reporting record sales of £30.7 billion in 2025 and a historic order backlog of £83.6 billion. The company’s financial strength is underpinned by a diversified product portfolio that spans air, maritime, land and space domains, and by a geographic footprint that generates roughly 45% of revenue from the United States, 25% from the United Kingdom and 15% from Saudi Arabia. This report analyses the current product suite, recent contract wins, and the strategic directions that are likely to shape BAE Systems’ product development through 2035.

## 2. Product Portfolio Overview

The core of BAE Systems’ product offering consists of advanced combat aircraft, naval platforms, land systems and emerging space capabilities. In the air domain the company supplies the Eurofighter Typhoon – exemplified by a €4 billion contract to deliver 20 aircraft to Turkey – and participates in the multinational F‑35 programme. Maritime products include the SSN‑AUKUS nuclear‑powered submarine family and a range of frigates and surface combatants for the Royal Navy. On land, BAE delivers the Challenger 3 main battle tank upgrade, CV90 infantry fighting vehicles (supported by a £160 million capacity expansion), and a full suite of weapons, munitions and sustainment services. The 2024 acquisition of Ball Aerospace created a dedicated Space & Mission Systems division, adding satellite, launch and space‑based ISR capabilities to the portfolio.

## 3. Recent Contract Wins and Market Position

In 2025 BAE Systems secured more than £27 billion ($35 billion) in new contracts, reflecting strong demand across all four domains. Highlights include the Eurofighter Typhoon award for Turkey, multiple missile‑system and electronic‑warfare contracts, and continued growth in the United States where defence spending remains elevated. The breadth of the order intake – aviation, naval, ground and electronic systems – reinforced the company’s claim that “operational performance continues to be strong” and demonstrated the resilience of its multi‑domain capabilities against geopolitical volatility.

## 4. Emerging Technology and Development Initiatives

BAE Systems is actively transitioning emerging technologies from research to operational use. According to the company’s 2026 technology outlook, artificial‑intelligence projects are moving from experimentation to real‑world defence operations, driven by the need for rapid innovation at “wartime pace”. Investment in digital intelligence and AI‑enabled cyber‑defence is being paired with expanded production capacity in customer countries, exemplified by a $200 million (£160 million) investment in the Hägglunds CV90 line. The Space & Mission Systems division is leveraging Ball Aerospace’s heritage to develop next‑generation satellite constellations and secure‑cloud services for defence customers.

## 5. Strategic Growth and Future Product Roadmap

Looking ahead, BAE Systems’ strategic roadmap centres on three pillars: (1) deepening existing platform families such as the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) fighter, which will replace legacy aircraft across Europe; (2) expanding space and cyber capabilities through modular satellite platforms and AI‑driven decision‑support tools; and (3) scaling production in allied markets to meet localisation requirements, as demonstrated by the CV90 capacity expansion and planned joint‑venture submarine facilities under the AUKUS partnership. Management has indicated confidence that sales will grow 7‑9% in 2026 and that cumulative free‑cash‑flow between 2026‑2028 will exceed £6 billion, providing the financial bandwidth to fund these product developments.

## 6. Summary

BAE Systems’ product suite in 2025 combined mature combat platforms with rapidly maturing digital and space technologies. Record contract wins and a robust order backlog confirm the company’s market leadership across air, sea, land and space. Ongoing investments in AI, cyber, and satellite systems, together with strategic capacity expansions and the GCAP fighter programme, position BAE Systems to capture the next wave of defence spending through the 2020s and into the 2030s. The evidence suggests that future product development will focus on integrated, AI‑enabled systems and expanded localisation, ensuring the firm remains a cornerstone of global defence capability.
