## 1. Introduction

This report provides a concise analysis of BAE Systems' key financial elements for the most recent reporting periods, focusing on the full‑year 2025 results, the contract wins and order backlog that underpin those results, and the outlook and guidance presented for 2026. All figures are drawn from the company’s publicly released statements and reputable industry summaries dated February 2026.

## 2. 2025 Financial Performance

BAE Systems reported record sales of £30.7 billion for the year ended 31 December 2025, representing a 10 percent increase year‑on‑year and an 8 percent rise in underlying revenue, driven by strong demand across air, maritime, land and space sectors.

Underlying earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose 12 percent to £3.32 billion, lifting the return on sales from 10.6 percent to 10.8 percent, while underlying earnings per share increased 12 percent to 75.2 pence.

Free cash flow was robust at £2,158 million, supported by significant customer advances received late in the year, and capital expenditure remained close to record levels at approximately £1 billion, with research and development spending also increasing.

The company returned £1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buy‑backs, reinforcing its commitment to a stable capital allocation strategy.

## 3. 2025 Contract Wins and Order Backlog

During 2025 BAE Systems secured more than £27 billion (approximately $35 billion) in new contracts, reflecting heightened global defence budgets and NATO modernisation programmes.

Notable awards included a €4 billion contract to build 20 Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft and integrate weapons systems for Turkey, with deliveries slated to begin in 2030, and a broad portfolio of contracts spanning aviation, naval, ground and electronic warfare systems.

The order backlog expanded by £5.8 billion to a record £83.6 billion, while order intake for the year reached £36.8 billion, underscoring the durability of BAE Systems' multi‑domain capabilities and geographic diversification.

## 4. 2026 Outlook and Guidance

Management projects sales growth of 7 to 9 percent in 2026, with full‑year operating profit expected to rise by around 12 percent, building on the record performance of the prior year.

The company anticipates cumulative free cash flow of more than £6 billion between 2026 and 2028, supported by continued investment in technology, selective acquisitions and a strong pipeline of programmes such as F‑35, Eurofighter Typhoon, SSN‑AUKUS submarines and the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP).

Geographically, the United States accounts for roughly 45 percent of total revenue, the United Kingdom 25 percent, and Saudi Arabia 15 percent, providing resilience against regional economic fluctuations.

Share price performance in 2026 has reinforced market confidence, with BAE Systems shares up 23 percent year‑to‑date and 56 percent above the same period in the prior year, reflecting investor optimism about the "new era" of defence spending.

## 5. Summary

BAE Systems delivered a record‑breaking financial year in 2025, with sales of £30.7 billion, underlying EBIT of £3.32 billion, and a strengthened order backlog of £83.6 billion. The company’s ability to win £27 billion in new contracts, including high‑profile programmes such as the Eurofighter Typhoon for Turkey, underpins this performance.

Looking ahead, the 2026 outlook signals continued revenue growth, robust free cash flow generation and sustained shareholder returns, while the diversified geographic revenue mix and expanding portfolio of advanced defence platforms position BAE Systems to capitalise on escalating global defence spending.
