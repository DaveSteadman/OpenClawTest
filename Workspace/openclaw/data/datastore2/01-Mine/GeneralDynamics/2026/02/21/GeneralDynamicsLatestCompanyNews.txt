  Most readers would already know that General Dynamics' (NYSE:GD) stock increased by 2.7% over the past three months. Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study General Dynamics' ROE in this article. Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money.

ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Dynamics is: 16% = US$4.2b ÷ US$26b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2025). The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company
