  Northrop Grumman is presenting a three-pronged approach to the U.S. Air Force if the service progresses with its current “family of systems” framework for future refuelers—from a large blended-wing body down to a small, uncrewed tanker, according to industry sources familiar with the plans. The prime’s strategy includes both an in-house design of the smaller, low-observable aircraft along with partnerships with other companies to offer the range of options for the Next-Generation Air Refueling System (NGAS) umbrella program. Northrop Grumman’s approach comes about two decades after it initially won the U.S. Air Force KC-X program to replace the KC-135 as part of a team with Airbus, before losing bidder Boeing successfully challenged the award and walked away the winner with the KC-46. Northrop Grumman and Embraer are announcing the new partnership on Feb. 19, using the latter’s KC-390 as a midsized “tactical” tanker for the service. This would be accompanied by the large, blended-wing-body demonstrator Northrop and partner JetZero are working on, bolstered by funding from the U.S. Air Force. The three-pronged approach would be presented as a package of options to the Air Force, allowing the service to pick and choose numbers of each option if it selects Northrop

  In early February 2026, Northrop Grumman’s board declared a quarterly dividend of US$2.31 per share, payable on March 11, 2026, to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2026. This announcement followed quarterly results where the company beat earnings expectations but issued softer sales and earnings guidance for 2026 despite a record US$95.70 billion backlog. Next, we’ll examine how Northrop’s earnings beat but softer 2026 guidance may affect its investment narrative and perceived growth quality. Capitalize on the AI infrastructure supercycle with our selection of the 34 best 'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush converting record-breaking demand into massive cash flow. To stay invested in Northrop Grumman, you need to believe that its large, long-duration defense programs and US$95.70 billion backlog can translate into resilient earnings despite program and budget risks. The latest earnings beat, muted 2026 guidance, and steady dividend do not materially change the near term story, where the key catalyst remains execution on flagship programs and the biggest risk is any disruption to major U.S. government contracts. The February 2026 dividend declaration of US$2.31 per share reinforces Northrop’s ongoing capital return pattern at a time when management is signaling only modest sales and earnings growth
