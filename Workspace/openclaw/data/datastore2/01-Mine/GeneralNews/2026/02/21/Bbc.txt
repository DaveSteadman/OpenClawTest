The Supreme Court decision striking down some of Trump's most sweeping tariffs injects new uncertainty into global trade. The six justices who voted against the tariffs, dealing a major blow to his signature economic policy, should be "absolutely ashamed", Trump said. Trump's new threat came a day after he appeared to give Iran about 10 days to agree to a deal to curb its nuclear programme. Deepfakes showing grim taxpayer-funded waterparks have gone viral and drawn some racist responses. The former Duke of York is eighth in line to the throne meaning he remains eligible to be King.

  At least 10 people have been killed in Israeli air strikes on eastern Lebanon, Lebanese officials say, despite a ceasefire. Israel's military said it targeted sites belonging to Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim militia and political party, in the Bekaa Valley, an area where the group has a strong presence. Hezbollah confirmed that at least six of its members had been killed, including a senior field commander. The strikes are among the deadliest in Lebanon since a ceasefire ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah in November 2024. Despite the deal, which followed 13 months of conflict , Israel has carried out near-daily strikes on Lebanon. Images posted online from one of the locations hit on Friday night showed heavy damage in what appeared to be a residential neighbourhood. In a statement, the Israeli military said it had struck "Hezbollah command centres" and that Hezbollah "systematically embeds its assets within the civilian population". It said the group's activities were "a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon". Hezbollah, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US, says the ceasefire deal only applies to southern Lebanon, in the area between the Litani river and the Blue Line, the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel. There, the Lebanese army has dismantled infrastructure used by the group , in

  A toddler in Italy who received a damaged donor heart has died, the family's lawyer has said. Two-year-old Domenico died shortly before 09:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Saturday, Francesco Petruzzi told reporters. Monaldi Hospital, where he was being treated, said he had suffered a "sudden and irreversible worsening of his clinical condition". The heart given to Domenico during a transplant in late December was reportedly transported to the hospital in direct contact with dry ice, causing severe tissue damage. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the incident and six medics have been placed under formal investigation in a case which has sparked outrage in Italy. Petruzzi has said the organ arrived "burned by frostbite" after being transported over 800km (490 miles) from Bolzano to Naples in an unsuitable container alongside the ice, without a thermometer to alert the medical team to the low temperature. The two-year-old had been on life support in Naples for almost two months. His mother Patrizia Mercolino had appealed to the Pope to help her son. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the "whole of Italy mourns the loss of little Domenico, a warrior who will never be forgotten". She wrote on X: "On behalf of myself and the government, I offer my sincerest condolences and deepest sympathy to his mother Patrizia, his father Antonio

  Five people were killed in a series of avalanches in the Austrian Alps as heavy snowfall hit the region on Friday. A 42-year-old German man, caught in an avalanche with his 16-year-old son, was among the victims, police said. The teenager was airlifted to hospital from the slope in Nauders near the Swiss-Italian border. Three other skiers were killed in an avalanche near the popular St Anton resort, while a snowboarder died after being buried in the neighbouring Vorarlberg region. Austria has now seen at least 21 avalanche-related deaths this winter, while dozens of fatalities have been recorded across the Alps. The avalanche risk remains high in parts of Tyrol - meaning avalanches can be expected - where two fatal avalanches occurred on Friday in off-piste areas. Police told Austrian media the avalanche near St Anton am Arlberg, which killed three men, appeared to have been triggered by the skiers themselves. Two were American and Polish nationals, public broadcaster ORF reported, while the third was a 21-year-old Austrian who died in hospital. Two other men were recovered from the scene with injuries after a major operation involving four mountain rescue teams, three helicopters, as well as emergency services. Elsewhere, a 53-year-old man died after being crushed by a snow plough in the northern city of Linz. The vehicle slid down

  Growing up in the Iranian capital Tehran, filmmaker Sara Khaki recalls seeing many examples of strong women in a male-dominated society. These were women "fighting for their independence and demanding space for their lives", she says. She later decided to research female entrepreneurs and activists in the country, and "came across this really amazing, tenacious individual who lives in the north-west of Iran, who rides a motorcycle, as the only female motorcycle rider in the region, and she's delivered 400 kids as a midwife". That woman is Sara Shahverdi. After months of phone calls to build up a relationship, Khaki and co-director Mohammadreza Eyni learned this woman was also running for a council seat - and decided to make a film about her. Cutting Through Rocks, as it is titled, has now become the first Iranian nominee for Best Documentary at the Oscars next month. The film follows Shahverdi as she runs for office in her village in the region of Zanjan, and deals with various obstacles as a female leader. We see her in a hall filled with 1,500 men representing all 300 local village councils. She wins the seat with the most votes - becoming the first woman to do so - and brings long-awaited fuel and electricity to the village. She pushes for land co-ownership between men

  US President Donald Trump lashed out in unusually personal terms against the six Supreme Court justices who handed him one of the biggest setbacks of his second term in office by striking down the administration's global tariffs. The court's Friday ruling was "deeply disappointing". The justices who joined the majority opinion should be "absolutely ashamed" and lacked the courage to "do the right thing", Trump said, turning his response into a sweeping attack against a co-equal branch of government. The broadside was remarkable even for a president known for blowing past political norms and publicly berating those who challenge his authority. "I'm ashamed of certain members of the court. Absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what's right for our country," Trump said at the start of a press conference at the White House, which was held a few hours after the decision was released. Trump did not mince words from there as he assessed the decision, which held that presidents do not have inherent authority to impose sweeping tariffs on any country. For the next 45 minutes, Trump criticised the ruling and made the case that he would find other methods to continue imposing tariffs on other countries. But throughout he repeatedly returned to the justices in ways that made clear he felt personally slighted by the

  US President Donald Trump has said he is considering a limited military strike on Iran in order to pressure its leaders to agree a deal to curb the nuclear programme. The president made the remark in response to a question from a journalist hours after officials had suggested the possibility of a strike. On Thursday, Trump said the world would find out "over the next, probably, 10 days" whether a deal would be reached or the US would take military action. The US has been increasing its military presence in the region in recent weeks. The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something Iran has always denied. US and Iranian officials have met over the issue in Switzerland and said progress has been made in the talks. Speaking on Friday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran was preparing "a draft of a possible agreement" and would hand it over to US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in the next few days. The talks in Geneva were held as American forces continued ramping up their presence in the vicinity of Iran. The deployment includes the world's largest warship, USS Gerald R Ford, appearing to be heading towards the region. USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is also being deployed, joining an

  The government is considering introducing legislation to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession. Defence Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC the move - which would prevent Andrew from ever becoming King - was the "right thing to do," regardless of the outcome of the police investigation. Currently Andrew, the King's brother, remains eighth in line to the throne despite being stripped of his titles, including "prince", last October amid pressure over his ties to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. On Thursday evening, Andrew was released under investigation 11 hours after his arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions programme, Pollard confirmed the government had "absolutely" been working with Buckingham Palace on the plans to stop the former prince from "potentially being a heartbeat away from the throne". He said this was "something that I hope will enjoy cross party support, but its right that that is something that only happens when the police investigation concludes". Chief Secretary to the Treasury James Murray told the BBC that "any questions in that sphere would be quite complicated", adding that the live police investigation needs to "play out". On Saturday, several unmarked police cars were again seen entering Royal Lodge, the 30-room Windsor property where

  Is the far left about to replace the far right as the pariah of French politics? The question is inescapable following the killing in Lyon of nationalist student Quentin Deranque by suspected far-left militants. Deranque was killed on 12 February after a small university protest by far-right feminists, who he was supposed to be protecting. Mobile phone footage shows him being repeatedly kicked and punched on the ground by masked and hooded young men. He died of head injuries. Since then a torrent of condemnation has come down on the main party on the radical left, La France Insoumise, and on its leader, veteran firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon. LFI - or France Unbowed - has a bloc of some 70 MPs in the 577-member National Assembly. The seven suspects now charged in connection with the killing were all members of, or close to, an organisation called La Jeune Garde (The Young Guard) which used to provide security for LFI before it was banned last year. One of the suspects – Jacques-Elie Favrot – was the salaried parliamentary assistant of an LFI deputy, Raphaël Arnault, who set up The Young Guard in 2018. Favrot has been charged with "complicity to murder by instigation", not with delivering the blows that killed Deranque. But Adrian Besseyre – who according to his lawyer also worked

  The US Supreme Court has ruled that President Donald Trump overstepped his powers when he imposed sweeping global tariffs last year. In its 6-3 decision, the court ruled that Trump could not use a 1977 law - the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) - to levy taxes on imports from nearly every country in the world. The ruling left open the possibility of consumers and businesses being given refunds for the estimated $130bn generated by the tariffs - a prospect that the high court did not weigh in on but is likely to end up in another court battle. Hours after the decision was released, Trump signed a proclamation using an alternative law, Section 122 of 1974's Trade Act, that would let him put a new 10% temporary tariff on goods from all countries. Here's what to know about what comes next on tariffs and what questions still remain. The Supreme Court decision released on 20 February relates only to tariffs that Trump had enacted under the IEEPA, which gives a president the power to regulate trade in response to an emergency. Trump first invoked it in February 2025 to tax goods from China, Mexico and Canada, saying fentanyl trafficking from those countries constituted an emergency. A few months later, on what Trump called "Liberation Day", he took a

  What can you tell about a video game from its price tag? In the UK, £70 may not gurantee quality, but it tends to mean you are getting a blockbuster or "AAA" - a big-budget game made by a large team, built around cutting-edge graphics, sprawling worlds and dozens of hours of gameplay. In 2025 Nintendo set a new benchmark for game prices when it listed major Switch titles such as Mario Kart World at £74.99 ($79.99). Meanwhile speculation grew from a 2025 report by gaming industry advisory company Epyllion that the next Grand Theft Auto will be the first game to be priced at $100, paving the way for others to either follow suit or at least contemplate a price hike. But a handful of recent games lauded for their AAA-feel by critics and gamers alike - such as ARC Raiders, Split Fiction, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - asked for more modest prices of £30-£40. No title has won more game of the year awards ( a whopping 436 ) than Clair Obscur, but Alexis Garavaryan, boss of publisher Kepler Interactive, told the BBC the decision to launch it below the blockbuster norm was, in fact, deliberate. "Ultimately we've seen a number of larger companies increase prices quite regularly. And we've kind of taken the opposite action," he told

  Growth in the US slowed at the end of last year, as consumer spending slackened and the federal government shut down. The world's largest economy grew at an annual pace of 1.4%% in the three months to December, falling back from a robust 4.4% in the prior quarter. It capped a turbulent year for the US economy, which has been buffeted by new tariffs, a crackdown on immigration, cuts to government spending and persistent inflation. Overall the economy grew 2.2% in 2025, performing better than many had anticipated in the face of those pressures. "The core of the economy is resilient," Michael Pearce, chief US economist at Oxford Economics wrote on Friday, adding that he expected growth to pick up again this year. Despite the underlying momentum, sharp swings in trade policy last year sent the economic data on a roller coaster ride. The year started in a mild contraction, fuelled in part by a jump in imports - which subtract from growth in calculations of gross domestic product (GDP) - as firms rushed goods into the country ahead of anticipated tariffs. Growth bounced back in the spring and summer, as foreign imports slowed, before decelerating again in the final months of the year, as imports started to recover.

  Celebrations in Canada over the decision by the US Supreme Court to strike down President Donald Trump's global tariffs were both brief and muted. The high court's decision, which included the "fentanyl" tariffs Trump imposed on Canada, China and Mexico, reinforced Canada's position that the levies were "unjustified", US-Canada Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc said on X. But LeBlanc noted the challenges ahead in Ottawa. There is the "critical work" to do in dealing with impacts from levies on steel, aluminium and automobiles, which Trump said will remain. There is also the upcoming review of the Canada-US-Mexico trade deal, the USMCA, which covers a market of more than 500 million people. The actual impact of the Supreme Court decision on Canadian tariffs is limited. Last year, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with Canada facing 25%, later raised to 35%, with the president arguing both countries must do more to stop migrants and the illegal drug fentanyl reaching the US. But the vast majority of trade, some 85%, under these "fentanyl" tariffs were already levy-free under a USMCA exemption. LeBlanc's office declined to comment on Trump's proclamation imposing a 10% global tariff to replace the duties imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which the Supreme Court struck down.

She might import more toys to the US and invest in designing new ones - things she had put on hold as Trump's levies on China, where her Canadian firm Wild Life Outdoor Adventures makes its products, took a 25% bite out of her profits last year. Still, uncertainty about refunds and other tariff authorities that the Trump administration might leverage is keeping her on edge. "I have a bit of reservation in too much celebration," she said. "But for us, every percentage point matters." Many business owners greeted the Supreme Court's ruling with cautious optimism. Their rejoicing was tempered by questions about a potentially complex process to obtain refunds for tariff fees they've already paid. Trump said on Friday he expected the issue to be tied up in court for years. And the Trump administration could still leverage other tariff authorities that were not implicated in the ruling. The Supreme Court case only covers duties that the Trump administration imposed using a 1977 law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).

  Donald Trump has introduced tariffs on goods coming into the US from most countries around the world. The US president argues that the taxes will boost domestic manufacturing and create jobs. But critics have warned of higher prices for consumers and damage to the global economy. On Friday, the US Supreme Court struck down some of the most significant tariffs. It ruled that Trump had exceeded his authority in using emergency powers to enact them on dozens of global trading partners. But Trump replaced those measures with a 10% global tariff using a different law. Typically, the charge is a percentage of a good's value. For example, a 10% tariff on a $10 product would mean a $1 tax on top - taking the total cost to $11 (£8.17). The tax is paid to the government by companies bringing in the foreign products. These firms may pass some or all of the extra cost on to their customers, which in this case means ordinary Americans and other US businesses. They may also decide to import fewer goods. Trump says tariffs increase the amount of tax raised by the government, encourage consumers to buy American-made goods and boost investment in the US. He wants to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from
