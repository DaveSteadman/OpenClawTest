The Albanese government told Kurdish authorities 11 ISIS-linked families in northeast Syria were ‘terrorists’ and that it did not want the women and children returned to Australia | WATCH As debate rages over the return of Australian ISIS brides, sympathy flows to their children but rarely their mothers.

Last year’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs now appear to be one the biggest overreaches by a US President in recent history, with the administration’s trade agenda plunged into deep uncertainty. Education ministers want school students to learn more about democracy, freedom and the rule of law – as well as the Aussie ‘fair go’.
