  Make better investment decisions with Simply Wall St's easy, visual tools that give you a competitive edge. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has introduced its Lamprey Multi-Mission Autonomous Undersea Vehicle, expanding its unmanned naval systems offering. The company has signed a framework agreement that targets a fourfold increase in THAAD missile interceptor production. Lockheed Martin is breaking ground on a new advanced manufacturing site, the Munitions Acceleration Center, to support higher output. For you as an investor, these moves sit at the intersection of defense technology and long cycle government programs. Lockheed Martin is a major contractor across air, land, sea and space, and the Lamprey undersea vehicle is part of a broader push toward autonomous systems and more distributed sensing in maritime defense. The THAAD agreement and new facility are directly related to demand for missile defense capabilities from government customers. Looking ahead, key considerations include how consistently these programs convert into funded orders and how efficiently the new manufacturing capacity ramps.
