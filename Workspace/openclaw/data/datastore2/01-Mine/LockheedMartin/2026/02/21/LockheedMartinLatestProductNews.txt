  SAN DIEGO — Lockheed Martin rapidly developed its new Lamprey multi-mission autonomous undersea vehicle: The company took just 14 months to develop Lamprey, with future plans to field larger variants and another drone by the end of the year. Lockheed Martin showcased a model of Lamprey for the first time at WEST 2026. Mark Johnson, program director for unmanned maritime solutions division, discussed the highlights and future iterations of the multi-mission system with Naval News . Named after the Lamprey, a fish that latches onto others with its sucking mouth, the drone combines numerous features that the company claims could achieve various tailored missions in support of covert surveillance and sea denial. Given the drone’s namesake, Johnson explained Lamprey comes with this unique ability to latch onto submarines, warships and the seabed. This brings many key implications for operational use. “This thing has suction cups on the top that basically can autonomously navigate to a sub, a ship, and it swims up and suctions on to the bottom of that vehicle,” said Johnson. “So it can hitch your ride into whatever theater it’s going to, because if you think about one of the restrictions or constraints of UUVs, it’s battery

  Lockheed Martin on Monday unveiled its Lamprey Multi‑Mission Autonomous Undersea Vehicle, an unmanned underwater vehicle that can attach itself to ships, launch torpedoes and deploy airborne drones. With a 24-foot payload bay, the Lamprey can be modified to perform a wide range of operations, from the seabed to the surface, according to the company. It can loiter on the ocean floor and recharge its batteries by attaching to a host ship, in addition to collecting intelligence from the ocean floor while offering a low stealth profile. Below the surface, the Lamprey can launch both antisubmarine torpedoes and decoys. At surface level, it can launch unmanned aerial vehicles into the air to conduct reconnaissance or deliver kinetic strikes. These capabilities enable the system to conduct antiship warfare both at surface level and underwater. “[Lamprey] was internally funded, letting us iterate at lightning speed and hand the Navy a true multi-mission weapon that detects, disrupts, decoys and engages on its own,” Paul Lemmo, vice president and general manager of sensors, effectors and mission systems at Lockheed Martin, said in a statement. Like many autonomous systems, the Lamprey can be deployed in swarms and communicate with other unmanned systems to perform missions. It

  Lockheed Martin Unveils Undersea Drone That Latches Onto Any Vessel The 21st century has seen a shift in warfare, specifically toward drone dominance. Since the United States began arming itself with the likes of the propeller-driven MQ-1 Predator and high-speed MQ-9 Reaper drones, militaries around the world have followed suit. It used to be that a drone was defined as something that flew, but these days they crawl, walk, fly, and swim, with new and highly capable drones emerging all the time. In February 2026, Lockheed Martin revealed its newest drone, called the Lamprey multi-mission autonomous undersea vehicle (MMAUV), and it's unlike anything that came before. Much like its namesake, which latches onto various marine organisms, Lockheed Martin's underwater Lamprey does the same, attaching itself to other vessels for transportation, and is packed with capabilities that make it particularly dangerous to any hostile nation. The Lamprey combines numerous mission capabilities into a single package, and its ability to loiter on the seafloor makes it far more dangerous than something like a low-tech marine mine. It can disrupt enemy sensors, fire its own short-range missiles or uncrewed aerial vehicles, and it can collect intelligence in ways no other marine drone could

  Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems have teamed up to develop a range of uncrewed air systems (UAS), all based on a common design, for which concept artwork has now been presented. The effort sees two of the world’s biggest defense contractors joining forces and entering a growing field of less expensive and more expendable drones and munitions. The collaboration was announced today at the Defense and Security Equipment International (DSEI) exhibition taking place in London. The partnership specifically involves the two companies’ advanced research and development divisions: Lockheed Martin Skunk Works and BAE Systems’ FalconWorks. Conceptual imagery of the UAS, so far unnamed, shows a missile-like vehicle with a body that is clearly optimized for low observability, with prominent chines. The UAS features notably long and narrow main wings, with seemingly limited sweep, V-shaped tailfins, and smaller, canted ventral fins. The overall size of the vehicle is not immediately apparent, and we have approached the manufacturers for more details about this and other aspects of the UAS. The companies describe the design as an autonomous UAS, although it’s unclear if it will have an optional “human in the loop” and to what degree.

  Latest news on Lockheed Martin, an American aerospace, defense, arms, security, and advanced technologies company with worldwide interests. It is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, and employs approximately 114,000 people worldwide. It is the world's largest defense contractor by revenue. Lockheed Martin was formed in 1995 by the merger of Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta, two major aerospace and defense companies. Lockheed Corporation was founded in 1926 as Lockheed Aircraft Company and produced many famous aircraft, such as the P-38 Lightning, the U-2 spy plane, the SR-71 Blackbird, and the F-117 Nighthawk. It also established a secret division called "Skunk Works" that became the leading U.S. developer of military aircraft. Martin Marietta was formed in 1961 by the merger of Martin Company and American-Marietta Company. Martin Company was a pioneer in rocket and missile development, producing the Titan family of launch vehicles and the Polaris, Poseidon, and Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles. It also built the Viking Mars landers and the Magellan spacecraft to Venus. Since its formation in 1995, Lockheed Martin has made a number of acquisitions, such as United Defense, Sandia National Laboratories, Sikorsky Aircraft, and Aerojet Rocketdyne. It has also sold or spun off some of its businesses, such

  The race to the Moon is on, and Lockheed Martin is confident that its inflatable habitat technology can help fast-track sustainable human operations, from Earth orbit to the lunar surface and beyond. Although the concept of inflatable structures in space is not new—as demonstrated by the human-rated Bigelow Expandable Activity Module that has been operating on the International Space Station since 2016—Lockheed Martin is developing an advanced in-house design that it says will provide higher performance, greater safety margins and faster build times than its competitors. To validate this, the company is conducting an intense test campaign of its softgoods technology, the culmination of which is expected to be an in-space demonstration in orbit—or on the lunar surface—around the end of the decade. The most dramatic of these tests involves deliberately overinflating the units until they burst under pressure, and Aviation Week was invited to witness the latest in the series. This test, the fifth burst evaluation conducted in the campaign, took place on a former Titan rocket test stand built deep into a ravine behind Lockheed Martin Space’s Waterton Canyon facility in Colorado.

  Defence manufacturer Lockheed Martin has secured an additional $4.2 billion from the US government to increase the production of two crucial long-range precision missiles. The 31 July contract adds more than $4 billion to an existing deal with Lockheed covering the production of the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) and Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), bringing the total value of the order to over $9 billion. That massive plus-up comes more two years after Lockheed completed work on a second JASSM/LRASM factory line in Troy, Alabama. The company has invested significantly to increase production capacity for the two long-range munitions, after receiving assurances from the US government that new orders would follow. “Increasing JASSM and LRASM production is essential for American and allied national security, and Lockheed Martin is ready to answer the call,” says Dave Berganini, Lockheed’s vice-president of hypersonic and strike systems. “We are leveraging our advanced manufacturing capabilities and investing in our production facilities to quickly and affordably deliver these critical capabilities war fighters need to maintain a strategic edge and protect our nation from emerging threats,” he adds. Lockheed declines to disclose its current production capacity for the two missile systems, which both use a common

  Boeing Co.

What Happened: "We clearly have a whole number of product lines that will contribute very well, that are going to fit very well with what is necessary to achieve the mission," said Tim Cahill , president of Missiles and Fire Control at Lockheed Martin, in a Reuters report published Monday. The report outlines that Lockheed Martin already supplies key components that could be incorporated into the Golden Dome, including missile detection systems and other components. Boeing, too, has signaled its involvement. Interim Defense and Space CEO Steve Parker noted that the aerospace giant has "done a lot of work" on the project, according to the report. Why It Matters: The news comes in as Trump's Golden Dome project is being eyed by several key players in the defense space as well as in Silicon Valley. Companies like SpaceX , Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR ) have emerged as frontrunners for key projects in the initiative. The project, which will reportedly cost over $175
