  Latest news on Lockheed Martin, an American aerospace, defense, arms, security, and advanced technologies company with worldwide interests. It is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, and employs approximately 114,000 people worldwide. It is the world's largest defense contractor by revenue. Lockheed Martin was formed in 1995 by the merger of Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta, two major aerospace and defense companies. Lockheed Corporation was founded in 1926 as Lockheed Aircraft Company and produced many famous aircraft, such as the P-38 Lightning, the U-2 spy plane, the SR-71 Blackbird, and the F-117 Nighthawk. It also established a secret division called "Skunk Works" that became the leading U.S. developer of military aircraft. Martin Marietta was formed in 1961 by the merger of Martin Company and American-Marietta Company. Martin Company was a pioneer in rocket and missile development, producing the Titan family of launch vehicles and the Polaris, Poseidon, and Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles. It also built the Viking Mars landers and the Magellan spacecraft to Venus. Since its formation in 1995, Lockheed Martin has made a number of acquisitions, such as United Defense, Sandia National Laboratories, Sikorsky Aircraft, and Aerojet Rocketdyne. It has also sold or spun off some of its businesses, such

  SAN DIEGO — Lockheed Martin rapidly developed its new Lamprey multi-mission autonomous undersea vehicle: The company took just 14 months to develop Lamprey, with future plans to field larger variants and another drone by the end of the year. Lockheed Martin showcased a model of Lamprey for the first time at WEST 2026. Mark Johnson, program director for unmanned maritime solutions division, discussed the highlights and future iterations of the multi-mission system with Naval News . Named after the Lamprey, a fish that latches onto others with its sucking mouth, the drone combines numerous features that the company claims could achieve various tailored missions in support of covert surveillance and sea denial. Given the drone’s namesake, Johnson explained Lamprey comes with this unique ability to latch onto submarines, warships and the seabed. This brings many key implications for operational use. “This thing has suction cups on the top that basically can autonomously navigate to a sub, a ship, and it swims up and suctions on to the bottom of that vehicle,” said Johnson. “So it can hitch your ride into whatever theater it’s going to, because if you think about one of the restrictions or constraints of UUVs, it’s battery

  SAN DIEGO — Lockheed Martin rapidly developed its new Lamprey multi-mission autonomous undersea vehicle: The company took just 14 months to develop Lamprey, with future plans to field larger variants and another drone by the end of the year. Lockheed Martin showcased a model of Lamprey for the first time at WEST 2026. Mark Johnson, program director for unmanned maritime solutions division, discussed the highlights and future iterations of the multi-mission system with Naval News . Named after the Lamprey, a fish that latches onto others with its sucking mouth, the drone combines numerous features that the company claims could achieve various tailored missions in support of covert surveillance and sea denial. Given the drone’s namesake, Johnson explained Lamprey comes with this unique ability to latch onto submarines, warships and the seabed. This brings many key implications for operational use. “This thing has suction cups on the top that basically can autonomously navigate to a sub, a ship, and it swims up and suctions on to the bottom of that vehicle,” said Johnson. “So it can hitch your ride into whatever theater it’s going to, because if you think about one of the restrictions or constraints of UUVs, it’s battery

  A technical hiccup with the new communications suite in the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules has brought the assembly line grinding to a halt. Lockheed Martin (LM) estimates the setback will cost the company around $140 million. Production will continue, and aircraft will be stored until issues are resolved with the problematic systems. LM anticipates delivering as many as two dozen to the United States Air Force this year despite the delay. Introduced in 2025 as an update to legacy components, testing of the new communication system revealed that there were compatibility issues requiring additional refinement. At least 154 of the total orders for 202 of the newest iteration of the tactical airlifter have already been delivered. The USAF has also received over 110 specialized variants based on the 'J' airframe , as released in a 2025 equipment report by Air & Space Forces magazine. Lockheed Martin only delivered two C-130J aircraft in 2025, with zero arriving in the last quarter of the year. This has put the brakes on a major modernization effort within the US Air Force. So far, some units have had their deliveries slide to the right by 6 months, which will require continued investment in

  Lockheed Martin ( (LMT) ) has held its Q4 earnings call. Read on for the main highlights of the call. Lockheed Martin Strikes Optimistic Tone Despite Profit Headwinds Lockheed Martin’s latest earnings call carried a decidedly upbeat tone, with management emphasizing powerful demand trends, record backlog, strong cash generation, and a sharply improved 2026 outlook. While executives acknowledged pressure on current-year earnings per share and segment margins in Aeronautics and Rotary & Mission Systems (RMS), they consistently framed these as timing- and program-related headwinds against a backdrop of rising sales, expanding missile capacity, and unusually strong long-term demand visibility. Overall, the narrative was one of a company leaning into investment and production ramps to capture a multi-year upcycle, even at the cost of near-term margin volatility. Lockheed Martin ended 2025 with a record backlog of $194.0 billion, roughly 2.5 times its annual sales and up $17.3 billion, or 17%, from the prior year. A full-year book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 underscores that new orders continue to outpace revenue, signaling broad-based and durable demand across its core defense programs. Management highlighted the backlog as a key foundation for visibility into growth through the decade, with heavy contributions from missile defense, precision weapons,

  On February 12, Lockheed Martin and Japanese technology company Fujitsu signed a contract for the initial procurement of components that supply power to the modular Subarray Suite (SAS), a critical element of the SPY-7 radar selected for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force’s (JMSDF) Aegis System Equipped Vessels (ASEV). A signing ceremony held in Tokyo formalized Fujitsu as a supplier of the SPY-7 Subarray Suite Power Supply Line Replaceable Unit (PS LRU). The PS LRU is a mission-critical naval radar assembly that delivers stable and regulated electrical power to the radar’s SAS modules, supporting reliable performance in demanding maritime operating conditions. The contract follows a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in May 2025 covering supplier selection and industrial partnership arrangements for the SPY-7 program. Under that framework, this marks the first procurement agreement between the two companies. The SPY-7 radar, developed by Lockheed Martin, is based on a scalable gallium nitride (GaN) Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) architecture designed to support ballistic missile defense (BMD) and integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) missions. The ASEV program is expected to serve as a core maritime component of Japan’s layered missile defense architecture. “Fujitsu is honored to commence mass production of the PS
