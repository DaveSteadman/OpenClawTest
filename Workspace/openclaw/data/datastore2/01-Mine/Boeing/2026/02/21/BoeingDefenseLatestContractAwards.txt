  HUNTSVILLE, Ala. , Oct. 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Boeing [NYSE: BA] has been awarded a combination of multiyear contracts valued at approximately $2.7 billion to produce additional Patriot Advanced Capability‑3 (PAC‑3) seekers. Under the agreements, Boeing will deliver more than 3,000 seekers at rates of up to 750 units per year through 2030. Boeing is working closely with prime contractor Lockheed Martin and the U.S. Army to further increase production rates and meet new targets for the PAC‑3 interceptor. Scaling seeker output is critical to ensuring the Patriot system can continue to defend service members, civilians and critical infrastructure worldwide as threats proliferate. "Our team has never been better positioned to answer the nation's call for greater air and missile defense," said Jim Bryan, executive director of Boeing Integrated Air & Missile Defense. "These multiyear awards recognize the progress we've made and will allow us to meet growing global demand for the PAC‑3 seeker." Boeing‑built PAC‑3 seekers enable Patriot interceptors to identify, track and defeat advanced threats, including hypersonic threats, hostile aircraft, and ballistic and cruise missiles. Demand for PAC‑3 interceptors has grown in response to recent conflicts and rapidly changing threat environments in Ukraine, the Middle East and the
