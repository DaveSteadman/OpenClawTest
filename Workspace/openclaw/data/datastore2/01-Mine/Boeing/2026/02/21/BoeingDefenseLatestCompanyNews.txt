  Boeing workers at three Midwest plants where military aircraft and weapons are developed voted Sunday to reject the company’s latest contract offer and to continue a strike that started almost three months ago. The strike by about 3,200 machinists at the plants in the Missouri cities of St. Louis and St. Charles, and in Mascoutah, Illinois , is smaller in scale than a walkout last year by 33,000 Boeing workers who assemble commercial jetliners but threatens to complicate the aerospace company’s progress in regaining its financial footing. “Boeing claimed they listened to their employees – the result of today’s vote proves they have not,” Brian Bryant, president of the International Association of Machinists union, said in a statement. Union leaders say talks have stalled over issues such as wages and retirement benefits, while Boeing has argued that workers’ demands exceed the cost of living in the Midwest. Ahead of Sunday’s vote, the union told its members that it did not recommend approval of the company’s latest offer, which it said “had no meaningful improvements” to retirement benefits and wage increases for workers with more seniority. Negotiations escalated over the summer in the days leading up to the strike, with the

  Boeing’s Defense, Space and Security headquarters is leaving Crystal City after nine years. The aerospace and defense company announced the move Wednesday, citing a desire to be “present and engaged with teammates who are designing, producing and delivering vital defense and space products and capabilities.” The St. Louis region is home to about 18,000 Boeing employees. The company did not say how many employees, if any, would relocate from here.

  WASHINGTON — Boeing’s defense unit will take $2 billion in losses on fixed-price contracts when it reports its third quarter results later this month, the company disclosed today, bringing total defense-related charges for the company up to $3.2 billion this year. The wider company also announced plans to slash 10 percent of its total workforce. The charges to its defense arm come as the US planemaker hemorrhages money amid an ongoing strike by its Seattle-area machinists union and as it announced the conclusion of its 767 freighter production — both factors the company states contributed to losses on the T-7A trainer, MQ-25 tanker drone, KC-46 tanker and NASA’s Starliner in the most recent financial quarter. The T-7 trainer logged the largest charge, worth $900 million, due to what the company said were higher estimated costs for production in 2026 and beyond. Behind it, the KC-46 logged a $700 million loss due to Boeing’s decision to end production of the 767 freighter, the commercial aircraft on which the militarized tanker is based. The company also pointed the finger at the ongoing machinists union strike , which has paused production of commercial airplanes, such as the 767 made in the company’s Seattle

  ST. LOUIS — The Boeing Co.'s defense, space and security division headquarters is moving back to St. Louis, the company said in a news release Wednesday. The division operated out of St. Louis from 1997 to 2017 when Boeing moved the defense headquarters to Arlington, Virginia. The relocation is effective as of Wednesday, and there is not a specific number of jobs associated with the move, according to a company spokesperson. Steve Parker, CEO for Boeing's defense, space and security division, said in a statement that "it's important for leaders to be side-by-side with our teammates, listening to their feedback and acting to remove obstacles as we continue to stabilize and strengthen our business. “The headquarters move, coupled with our senior leaders being based at and spending their time at major engineering, production and manufacturing centers across the U.S., reflects our continued focus on disciplined performance across our business," Parker said. The defense headquarters' previous move to the Washington, D.C., area, announced in late 2016, reflected the aerospace giant's desire to be closer to the levers of power in the nation’s capital. The company expected about 50 positions to eventually relocate to the Virginia headquarters. Boeing said Wednesday it employs 18,000+ workers in St. Louis. U.S. Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., cheered the news. "This announcement helps to reinforce the great

  Boeing was among the most prominent exhibitors at the World Defense Show (WDS) 2026 , held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from February 8-12, 2026. The US manufacturer demonstrated its strong presence within a market in which it maintains a significant footprint across both civilian and military sectors. Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries in the world to host a dedicated Boeing office, a fact that underscores the strategic importance that Boeing gives to its relationship with the Middle Eastern Kingdom. To learn more about Boeing’s regional footprint and its plans for the Middle East in the field of defense and space, AeroTime spoke with Kirk Schultz, Regional Director for International Business Development at Boeing Defense, Space and Security, during WDS. Schultz began by emphasizing the importance of WDS as a platform to showcase the company’s broad portfolio of solutions. “If you had the chance to go out on the ramp, you could see some of our fantastic flagship products—the AH-64, the CH-47, F-15s, and a KC-46 – on display,” he noted. A Saudi-operated F-15 also participated in the show’s flying display. In fact, Saudi Arabia operates nearly 400 military aircraft made by Boeing, making it one of the largest operators of the firm’s defense systems outside the United States. “We’re just really happy to be here at WDS,”

In January, Boeing reported one of its strongest recent months for aircraft orders and deliveries, including a substantial widebody order from Delta Air Lines. The company secured significant long term U.S. Air Force contracts tied to C-17A fleet upgrades. Boeing announced plans for a new 737 Max assembly line while unions raised concerns about potential job relocations to South Carolina. Boeing (NYSE:BA) enters this news cycle with its shares at $236.26 and a 1 year return of 26.9%. Over 3 and 5 years, returns of 8.7% and 9.6% respectively suggest a mixed but positive longer term picture. This context can shape how investors interpret these new commercial, defense, and operational developments.

  Several thousand Boeing machinists in the Midwest who assemble military aircraft and weapons voted Thursday to approve a new contract, ending a three-month strike that saw them reject four earlier offers from the company. The breakthrough five-year labor agreement includes a 24% wage hike across the life of the contract and a $6,000 signing bonus, according to the union representing the 3,200 workers who walked off the job Aug. 4. “We’re proud of what our members have fought for together and are ready to get back to building the world’s most advanced military aircraft,” the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said in a statement. With their new contract in hand, the machinists are set to return to work Sunday at manufacturing plants in the Missouri cities of St. Louis and St. Charles, as well as in Mascoutah, Illinois. The workers build fighter jets, weapons systems and the U.S. Navy’s first carrier-based unmanned aircraft at those facilities. Boeing said in a statement that it looks forward to “bringing our full team back together.” While the strike was smaller than last year’s walkout by 33,000 Boeing workers who build commercial jetliners, it still threatened to slow the aerospace company’s efforts to regain its financial footing. Boeing’s Defense, Space & Security division makes up more than a third of its revenue.

  Boeing Defense was awarded $930.8 million in a new U.S. Navy contract to provide “service life modifications” for up to 60 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet fighter jets. The goal is to extend the service life for the aircraft from 6,000 to 10,000 flight hours, and also to integrate Block III avionics capabilities. The F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornets are twin-engine multi-role aircraft in service to the U.S. Navy and several allied defense forces. The F/A-18 program has been in place since 1995, but Boeing is due to end the series production this year. The Navy operates several hundred of the fighters, most of which are dated to Block II of the series. Block III was introduced in 2020 , and incorporates multiple improvements in networking capabilities, data processing power, range, and fuel capacity. The latest series has a service life of 10,000 flight hours as a standard. F/18 Block III avionics present a significant upgrade over Block II, and include an Advanced Cockpit System with a 10x19-inch touchscreen display in place of multiple smaller screens; a distributed targeting processor network for faster data processing; and the tactical targeting network technology that boosts data sharing; and an open mission systems architecture for future upgrades. The Boeing Defense explained that “Block III transforms the Super Hornet into a more connected, aware, and

  When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard. Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences. At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots , with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000 . Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040. And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy. It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide. Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential. The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates. And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors. What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution. In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should

  Former special assistant to President Biden Michael LaRosa and Washington Times editor-at-large Alex Swoyer join 'America Reports' to react to Virginia Democrat Gov. Abigail Spanberger's controversial start to her term. NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles! After nearly a decade in Virginia, Boeing announced on Wednesday that it is moving its Defense, Space & Security headquarters out of the state back to St. Louis. This comes just weeks after new Democratic Gov. Abigail Spanberger took office, replacing Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. In a Wednesday statement, Boeing said its decision to move its defense headquarters to St. Louis emphasizes company leadership’s "commitment to being present and engaged with teammates who are designing, producing and delivering vital defense and space products and capabilities for customers in the U.S. and around the world." The company said it is progressing on a multibillion-dollar investment in "the world’s most advanced combat aircraft production facilities," including in St. Louis. The change moves the defense headquarters from Arlington, Virginia , back to its former site in St. Louis, where much of the company’s products are designed and manufactured.

  Boeing workers at three Midwest plants where military aircraft and weapons are developed voted Sunday to reject the company’s latest contract offer and to continue a strike that started almost three months ago. The strike by about 3,200 machinists at the plants in the Missouri cities of St. Louis and St. Charles, and in Mascoutah, Illinois , is smaller in scale than a walkout last year by 33,000 Boeing workers who assemble commercial jetliners but threatens to complicate the aerospace company’s progress in regaining its financial footing. “Boeing claimed they listened to their employees – the result of today’s vote proves they have not,” Brian Bryant, president of the International Association of Machinists union, said in a statement. Union leaders say talks have stalled over issues such as wages and retirement benefits, while Boeing has argued that workers’ demands exceed the cost of living in the Midwest. Ahead of Sunday’s vote, the union told its members that it did not recommend approval of the company’s latest offer, which it said “had no meaningful improvements” to retirement benefits and wage increases for workers with more seniority. Negotiations escalated over the summer in the days leading up to the strike, with the workers rejecting an earlier proposed agreement that included a 20% wage hike over the life of the five-year contract.

  ST. LOUIS — The Boeing Co.'s defense, space and security division headquarters is moving back to St. Louis, the company said in a news release Wednesday. The division operated out of St. Louis from 1997 to 2017 when Boeing moved the defense headquarters to Arlington, Virginia. The relocation is effective as of Wednesday, and there is not a specific number of jobs associated with the move, according to a company spokesperson. Steve Parker, CEO for Boeing's defense, space and security division, said in a statement that "it's important for leaders to be side-by-side with our teammates, listening to their feedback and acting to remove obstacles as we continue to stabilize and strengthen our business. “The headquarters move, coupled with our senior leaders being based at and spending their time at major engineering, production and manufacturing centers across the U.S., reflects our continued focus on disciplined performance across our business," Parker said. The defense headquarters' previous move to the Washington, D.C., area, announced in late 2016, reflected the aerospace giant's desire to be closer to the levers of power in the nation’s capital. The company expected about 50 positions to eventually relocate to the Virginia headquarters. Boeing said Wednesday it employs

  Boeing was among the most prominent exhibitors at the World Defense Show (WDS) 2026 , held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from February 8-12, 2026. The US manufacturer demonstrated its strong presence within a market in which it maintains a significant footprint across both civilian and military sectors. Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries in the world to host a dedicated Boeing office, a fact that underscores the strategic importance that Boeing gives to its relationship with the Middle Eastern Kingdom. To learn more about Boeing’s regional footprint and its plans for the Middle East in the field of defense and space, AeroTime spoke with Kirk Schultz, Regional Director for International Business Development at Boeing Defense, Space and Security, during WDS. Schultz began by emphasizing the importance of WDS as a platform to showcase the company’s broad portfolio of solutions. “If you had the chance to go out on the ramp, you could see some of our fantastic flagship products—the AH-64, the CH-47, F-15s, and a KC-46 – on display,” he noted. A Saudi-operated F-15 also participated in the show’s flying display. In fact, Saudi Arabia operates nearly 400 military aircraft made by Boeing, making it one of the

  Several thousand Boeing machinists in the Midwest who assemble military aircraft and weapons voted Thursday to approve a new contract, ending a three-month strike that saw them reject four earlier offers from the company. The breakthrough five-year labor agreement includes a 24% wage hike across the life of the contract and a $6,000 signing bonus, according to the union representing the 3,200 workers who walked off the job Aug. 4. “We’re proud of what our members have fought for together and are ready to get back to building the world’s most advanced military aircraft,” the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said in a statement. With their new contract in hand, the machinists are set to return to work Sunday at manufacturing plants in the Missouri cities of St. Louis and St. Charles, as well as in Mascoutah, Illinois. The workers build fighter jets, weapons systems and the U.S. Navy’s first carrier-based unmanned aircraft at those facilities. Boeing said in a statement that it looks forward to “bringing our full team back together.” While the strike was smaller than last year’s walkout by 33,000 Boeing workers who build commercial jetliners, it still threatened to slow the aerospace company’s efforts

  Boeing Defense was awarded $930.8 million in a new U.S. Navy contract to provide “service life modifications” for up to 60 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet fighter jets. The goal is to extend the service life for the aircraft from 6,000 to 10,000 flight hours, and also to integrate Block III avionics capabilities. The F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornets are twin-engine multi-role aircraft in service to the U.S. Navy and several allied defense forces. The F/A-18 program has been in place since 1995, but Boeing is due to end the series production this year. The Navy operates several hundred of the fighters, most of which are dated to Block II of the series. Block III was introduced in 2020 , and incorporates multiple improvements in networking capabilities, data processing power, range, and fuel capacity. The latest series has a service life of 10,000 flight hours as a standard. F/18 Block III avionics present a significant upgrade over Block II, and include an Advanced Cockpit System with a 10x19-inch touchscreen display in place of multiple smaller screens; a distributed targeting processor network for faster data processing; and the tactical targeting network technology that boosts data sharing; and an open mission systems architecture

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences. At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots , with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000 . Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040. And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy. It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide. Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

  ST. LOUIS — The Boeing Co.'s defense, space and security division headquarters is moving back to St. Louis, the company said in a news release Wednesday. The division operated out of St. Louis from 1997 to 2017 when Boeing moved the defense headquarters to Arlington, Virginia. The relocation is effective as of Wednesday, and there is not a specific number of jobs associated with the move, according to a company spokesperson. Steve Parker, CEO for Boeing's defense, space and security division, said in a statement that "it's important for leaders to be side-by-side with our teammates, listening to their feedback and acting to remove obstacles as we continue to stabilize and strengthen our business. “The headquarters move, coupled with our senior leaders being based at and spending their time at major engineering, production and manufacturing centers across the U.S., reflects our continued focus on disciplined performance across our business," Parker said. The defense headquarters' previous move to the Washington, D.C., area, announced in late 2016, reflected the aerospace giant's desire to be closer to the levers of power in the nation’s capital. The company expected about 50 positions to eventually relocate to the Virginia headquarters. Boeing said Wednesday it employs

  Boeing was among the most prominent exhibitors at the World Defense Show (WDS) 2026 , held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from February 8-12, 2026. The US manufacturer demonstrated its strong presence within a market in which it maintains a significant footprint across both civilian and military sectors. Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries in the world to host a dedicated Boeing office, a fact that underscores the strategic importance that Boeing gives to its relationship with the Middle Eastern Kingdom. To learn more about Boeing’s regional footprint and its plans for the Middle East in the field of defense and space, AeroTime spoke with Kirk Schultz, Regional Director for International Business Development at Boeing Defense, Space and Security, during WDS. Schultz began by emphasizing the importance of WDS as a platform to showcase the company’s broad portfolio of solutions. “If you had the chance to go out on the ramp, you could see some of our fantastic flagship products—the AH-64, the CH-47, F-15s, and a KC-46 – on display,” he noted. A Saudi-operated F-15 also participated in the show’s flying display. In fact, Saudi Arabia operates nearly 400 military aircraft made by Boeing, making it one of the

  Several thousand Boeing machinists in the Midwest who assemble military aircraft and weapons voted Thursday to approve a new contract, ending a three-month strike that saw them reject four earlier offers from the company. The breakthrough five-year labor agreement includes a 24% wage hike across the life of the contract and a $6,000 signing bonus, according to the union representing the 3,200 workers who walked off the job Aug. 4. “We’re proud of what our members have fought for together and are ready to get back to building the world’s most advanced military aircraft,” the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said in a statement. With their new contract in hand, the machinists are set to return to work Sunday at manufacturing plants in the Missouri cities of St. Louis and St. Charles, as well as in Mascoutah, Illinois. The workers build fighter jets, weapons systems and the U.S. Navy’s first carrier-based unmanned aircraft at those facilities. Boeing said in a statement that it looks forward to “bringing our full team back together.” While the strike was smaller than last year’s walkout by 33,000 Boeing workers who build commercial jetliners, it still threatened to slow the aerospace company’s efforts

  Boeing Defense was awarded $930.8 million in a new U.S. Navy contract to provide “service life modifications” for up to 60 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet fighter jets. The goal is to extend the service life for the aircraft from 6,000 to 10,000 flight hours, and also to integrate Block III avionics capabilities. The F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornets are twin-engine multi-role aircraft in service to the U.S. Navy and several allied defense forces. The F/A-18 program has been in place since 1995, but Boeing is due to end the series production this year. The Navy operates several hundred of the fighters, most of which are dated to Block II of the series. Block III was introduced in 2020 , and incorporates multiple improvements in networking capabilities, data processing power, range, and fuel capacity. The latest series has a service life of 10,000 flight hours as a standard. F/18 Block III avionics present a significant upgrade over Block II, and include an Advanced Cockpit System with a 10x19-inch touchscreen display in place of multiple smaller screens; a distributed targeting processor network for faster data processing; and the tactical targeting network technology that boosts data sharing; and an open mission systems architecture

In January, Boeing reported one of its strongest recent months for aircraft orders and deliveries, including a substantial widebody order from Delta Air Lines. The company secured significant long term U.S. Air Force contracts tied to C-17A fleet upgrades. Boeing announced plans for a new 737 Max assembly line while unions raised concerns about potential job relocations to South Carolina. Boeing (NYSE:BA) enters this news cycle with its shares at $236.26 and a 1 year return of 26.9%. Over 3 and 5 years, returns of 8.7% and 9.6% respectively suggest a mixed but positive longer term picture. This context can shape how investors interpret these new commercial, defense, and operational developments. For investors, the combination of strong January activity, new defense contracts, and production changes raises questions about Boeing’s capacity, margins, and labor risk in the coming years. These types of business shifts can influence how stable future cash flows may be, so they are worth monitoring alongside the share price and individual risk tolerance.

The defense headquarters' previous move to the Washington, D.C., area, announced in late 2016, reflected the aerospace giant's desire to be closer to the levers of power in the nation’s capital. The company expected about 50 positions to eventually relocate to the Virginia headquarters. Boeing said Wednesday it employs

  Boeing was among the most prominent exhibitors at the World Defense Show (WDS) 2026 , held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from February 8-12, 2026. The US manufacturer demonstrated its strong presence within a market in which it maintains a significant footprint across both civilian and military sectors. Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries in the world to host a dedicated Boeing office, a fact that underscores the strategic importance that Boeing gives to its relationship with the Middle Eastern Kingdom. To learn more about Boeing’s regional footprint and its plans for the Middle East in the field of defense and space, AeroTime spoke with Kirk Schultz, Regional Director for International Business Development at Boeing Defense, Space and Security, during WDS. Schultz began by emphasizing the importance of WDS as a platform to showcase the company’s broad portfolio of solutions. “If you had the chance to go out on the ramp, you could see some of our fantastic flagship products—the AH-64, the CH-47, F-15s, and a KC-46 – on display,” he noted. A Saudi-operated F-15 also participated in the show’s flying display. In fact, Saudi Arabia operates nearly 400 military aircraft made by Boeing, making it one of the

  Several thousand Boeing machinists in the Midwest who assemble military aircraft and weapons voted Thursday to approve a new contract, ending a three-month strike that saw them reject four earlier offers from the company. The breakthrough five-year labor agreement includes a 24% wage hike across the life of the contract and a $6,000 signing bonus, according to the union representing the 3,200 workers who walked off the job Aug. 4. “We’re proud of what our members have fought for together and are ready to get back to building the world’s most advanced military aircraft,” the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said in a statement. With their new contract in hand, the machinists are set to return to work Sunday at manufacturing plants in the Missouri cities of St. Louis and St. Charles, as well as in Mascoutah, Illinois. The workers build fighter jets, weapons systems and the U.S. Navy’s first carrier-based unmanned aircraft at those facilities. Boeing said in a statement that it looks forward to “bringing our full team back together.” While the strike was smaller than last year’s walkout by 33,000 Boeing workers who build commercial jetliners, it still threatened to slow the aerospace company’s efforts

  Boeing Defense was awarded $930.8 million in a new U.S. Navy contract to provide “service life modifications” for up to 60 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet fighter jets. The goal is to extend the service life for the aircraft from 6,000 to 10,000 flight hours, and also to integrate Block III avionics capabilities. The F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornets are twin-engine multi-role aircraft in service to the U.S. Navy and several allied defense forces. The F/A-18 program has been in place since 1995, but Boeing is due to end the series production this year. The Navy operates several hundred of the fighters, most of which are dated to Block II of the series. Block III was introduced in 2020 , and incorporates multiple improvements in networking capabilities, data processing power, range, and fuel capacity. The latest series has a service life of 10,000 flight hours as a standard. F/18 Block III avionics present a significant upgrade over Block II, and include an Advanced Cockpit System with a 10x19-inch touchscreen display in place of multiple smaller screens; a distributed targeting processor network for faster data processing; and the tactical targeting network technology that boosts data sharing; and an open mission systems architecture

  When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard. Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences. At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots , with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000 . Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040. And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy. It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide. Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential. The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates. And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors. What most investors don’t realize is that one
