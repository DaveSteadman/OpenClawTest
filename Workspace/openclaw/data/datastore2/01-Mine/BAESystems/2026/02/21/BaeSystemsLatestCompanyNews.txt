  Unite, which represents 5,000 workers at BAE's factories in Warton and Samlesbury, said its workers "know their value and want their fair share of the pie". The union said higher-skilled staff at the sites were last year given 3.6% pay increases "against their will", while those on the factory floor agreed to a 4.2% rise and an extra day off. Local Unite organiser Ross Quinn said the striking staff, on average salaries of £50,000, were "crucial" to BAE's success. And Sharon Graham, Unite's general secretary, said: "BAE's profits are little short of obscene. The company is making billions from government contracts and yet refuses to pay our members what they are worth." BAE has offered 3.7% raises for 2026. Those on strike are demanding 5.2% increases to account for last year's below-inflation raises. A BAE Systems spokesperson said the current offer "is fair and ensures that our employees continued to receive market-leading pay and rewards, while balancing our need to be competitive and affordable for our customers". On the prospect of strike action continuing into March, BAE said: "With the majority of our employees working as normal, we are focused on minimising any disruption and implementing our robust contingency plans."

  Latest news on BAE Systems, a British multinational arms, security, and aerospace company based in London, England. It is the largest defence contractor in Europe, and ranked the seventh-largest in the world based on applicable 2021 revenues. BAE Systems was formed in 1999 from the merger of British Aerospace (BAe) with Marconi Electronic Systems, the defence electronics and naval shipbuilding subsidiary of the General Electric Company plc (GEC). BAe, in turn, dates to the merger (1977, with two other firms) of British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) and Hawker Siddeley Aviation, both having been nationalised a year earlier owing to unprofitable financial situations. Through its BAe antecedents, BAE Systems carries the legacy of some 20 British aircraft firms (e.g., Bristol, Avro, Gloster, De Havilland, Supermarine), several dating to the first decades of flight. In the 1960s and early ’70s, BAC and Hawker Siddeley each produced significant aircraft. BAC built the Vickers-Armstrongs VC10 and BAC One-Eleven jetliners and, in partnership with Aerospatiale of France, the Concorde supersonic transport. Hawker Siddeley developed the HS 121 Trident jetliner, Vulcan bomber, and Harrier vertical/short-takeoff-and-landing (V/STOL) fighter. Since its formation in 1999, BAE has made a number of acquisitions, most notably of United Defense and Armor Holdings

  BAE Systems has set new records with its annual results amid a ramping-up in global defence spending as geopolitical uncertainty remains heightened. Europe’s biggest defence contractor reported better-than-expected underlying earnings before interest and taxes of £3.32 billion for 2025, up 12% on the previous year, as sales jumped 10% to a record high of £30.66 billion. The aerospace and weapons manufacturer said its order backlog also hit a record £83.6 billion as of the end of December while its order intake stood at £36.8 billion. Chief executive Charles Woodburn said: “In a new era of defence spending, driven by escalating security challenges, we’re well-positioned to provide both the advanced conventional systems and disruptive technologies needed to protect the nations we serve now and into the future. “With a record order backlog and continuing investment in our business to enhance agility, efficiency and capacity, we’re confident in our ability to keep delivering growth over the coming years.” The firm forecast further growth in 2026, albeit at a slower pace, with the firm pencilling in underlying earnings growth of between 9% to 11% and sales to rise by between 7% and 9%.

  BAE Systems attracted record orders in 2025, and now the UK defense staple is setting its sights on years of growth amid a global ramp-up in spending. Its shares rose 3.6% on Wednesday after its full-year earnings report showed sales soared 10% last year to reach a record £30.7 billion ($41.7 billion). That helped push operating profits to £2.93 billion, a 9% year-on-year increase, as revenues grew 8% to £28.3 billion. The FTSE 100 -listed company, which manufactures a range of aircraft, weapons, munitions and warships, saw its order backlog hit £83.6 billion, a £5.8 billion increase from 2024. Now, BAE is preparing to capitalize on years of future growth as geopolitical fissures usher in what CEO Charles Woodburn called a "new era of defense spending" driven by "escalating security challenges." The company expects sales to grow by between 7% and 9% in 2026, with guidance for cumulative free cash flow between 2026 and 2028 in excess of £6 billion. "We're well positioned to provide both the advanced conventional systems and disruptive technologies needed to protect the nations we serve now and into the future," Woodburn said in a statement accompanying Wednesday's earnings.

Unite the union, the country’s leading trade union for defence and aerospace, has slammed military-industrial giant BAE Systems for making obscene profits while at the same time refusing to pay its workers a fair wage. The union has also criticised BAE for attempting union-busting high court injunctions to prevent strikes.

Meanwhile skilled workers at their Lancashire factories in Warton and Salmesbury are being forced to take industrial action due to a poor pay offer and assault on their terms and conditions.

  UK airframer BAE Systems remains confident that Saudi Arabia will place a long-anticipated follow-on order for the Eurofighter Typhoon, as Riyadh also eyes a possible future role in the currently three-nation Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP). The Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) currently operates 72 BAE-assembled Typhoons, fielded from 2008 via the Project Salam acquisition. The European type also is being considered for a 54-aircraft need, which also has seen Riyadh look at the Boeing F-15EX and Dassault Aviation Rafale as part of a competitive evaluation. “We are still supporting the UK government in responding to the requirement for new Typhoons,” BAE’s Saudi Arabia managing director Steve Clutton said at the World Defense Show (WDS). “Discussions are ongoing, and it has been a great opportunity at the show this week,” he says of the 8-12 February event, which was staged near Riyadh. A repeat Typhoon order would be linked to a “substantial industrialisation package”, he says. That would include in-country final assembly of the type, in support of the customer’s Vision 2030 localisation process. Under a previous deal, 22 of the RSAF’s BAE Hawk 165 advanced jet trainers were assembled at the service’s Dhahran air base. Clutton also notes that

  UK airframer BAE Systems remains confident that Saudi Arabia will place a long-anticipated follow-on order for the Eurofighter Typhoon, as Riyadh also eyes a possible future role in the currently three-nation Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP). The Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) currently operates 72 BAE-assembled Typhoons, fielded from 2008 via the Project Salam acquisition. The European type also is being considered for a 54-aircraft need, which also has seen Riyadh look at the Boeing F-15EX and Dassault Aviation Rafale as part of a competitive evaluation. “We are still supporting the UK government in responding to the requirement for new Typhoons,” BAE’s Saudi Arabia managing director Steve Clutton said at the World Defense Show (WDS). “Discussions are ongoing, and it has been a great opportunity at the show this week,” he says of the 8-12 February event, which was staged near Riyadh. A repeat Typhoon order would be linked to a “substantial industrialisation package”, he says. That would include in-country final assembly of the type, in support of the customer’s Vision 2030 localisation process. Under a previous deal, 22 of the RSAF’s BAE Hawk 165 advanced jet trainers were assembled at the service’s Dhahran air base. Clutton also notes that

  'Without the skilled work of our members, the company doesn't make money." Unite the union, the country’s leading trade union for defence and aerospace, has slammed military-industrial giant BAE Systems for making obscene profits while at the same time refusing to pay its workers a fair wage. The union has also criticised BAE for attempting union-busting high court injunctions to prevent strikes. The latest financial results show BAE’s full year operating profits increased by 12% to £3.32 billion. Meanwhile skilled workers at their Lancashire factories in Warton and Salmesbury are being forced to take industrial action due to a poor pay offer and assault on their terms and conditions. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “These profits are nothing short of obscene. BAE is making billions from government contracts and yet refuses to pay our members what they are worth. This is completely unacceptable – without the skilled work of our members, the company doesn’t make money.” Additionally, it’s most recent trading statement shows that BAE Systems shareholders received £1.5bn in dividends in 2025.

  UK airframer BAE Systems remains confident that Saudi Arabia will place a long-anticipated follow-on order for the Eurofighter Typhoon, as Riyadh also eyes a possible future role in the currently three-nation Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP). The Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) currently operates 72 BAE-assembled Typhoons, fielded from 2008 via the Project Salam acquisition. The European type also is being considered for a 54-aircraft need, which also has seen Riyadh look at the Boeing F-15EX and Dassault Aviation Rafale as part of a competitive evaluation. “We are still supporting the UK government in responding to the requirement for new Typhoons,” BAE’s Saudi Arabia managing director Steve Clutton said at the World Defense Show (WDS). “Discussions are ongoing, and it has been a great opportunity at the show this week,” he says of the 8-12 February event, which was staged near Riyadh. A repeat Typhoon order would be linked to a “substantial industrialisation package”, he says. That would include in-country final assembly of the type, in support of the customer’s Vision 2030 localisation process. Under a previous deal, 22 of the RSAF’s BAE Hawk 165 advanced jet trainers were assembled at the service’s Dhahran air base. Clutton also notes that

  'Without the skilled work of our members, the company doesn't make money." Unite the union, the country’s leading trade union for defence and aerospace, has slammed military-industrial giant BAE Systems for making obscene profits while at the same time refusing to pay its workers a fair wage. The union has also criticised BAE for attempting union-busting high court injunctions to prevent strikes. The latest financial results show BAE’s full year operating profits increased by 12% to £3.32 billion. Meanwhile skilled workers at their Lancashire factories in Warton and Salmesbury are being forced to take industrial action due to a poor pay offer and assault on their terms and conditions. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “These profits are nothing short of obscene. BAE is making billions from government contracts and yet refuses to pay our members what they are worth. This is completely unacceptable – without the skilled work of our members, the company doesn’t make money.” Additionally, it’s most recent trading statement shows that BAE Systems shareholders received £1.5bn in dividends in 2025. In 2025, workers had a pay deal of 3.6 per cent imposed against their will, which was below the rate of inflation, and which represents a

  “The company is making billions from government contracts and yet refuses to pay our members what they are worth. This is completely unacceptable – without the skilled work of our members, the company doesn’t make money.” Union members were particularly concerned about the pay deal of 3.6% which they say was below the rate of inflation. They said this was later imposed against their will and below the 4.5% increase given to shop floor workers. BAE Systems told Blog Preston in 2025 , ahead of the start of action in November, that the higher pay increase offered to shop floor workers was recognition of lower pay in that area of the business and in exchange for other changes to working practices. They told us this week that the dispute pay offer was implemented in the professional services area because negotiations had been exhausted through the disputes procedure. Around 200 people are expected to take part in strike action between now and 13 March. A spokesperson for BAE Systems said: “Our priority remains to protect our people, our business and the vital work we do for our customers. “We believe the Company’s offer is fair and ensures that our employees continued
