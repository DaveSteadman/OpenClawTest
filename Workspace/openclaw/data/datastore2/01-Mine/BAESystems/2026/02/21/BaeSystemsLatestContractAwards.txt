  BAE Systems has already won more than 27 billion pounds ($35 billion) in contracts in 2025, reflecting strong global demand for its defense platforms and technologies. Trading in the second half of the year has remained in line with expectations, the company said in a market update . It noted that operational performance “continues to be strong” as it delivers critical capabilities across combat aircraft, submarines, missile systems, and electronic warfare. The surge in contracts highlights the continuing impact of rising defense budgets and NATO modernization programs on global procurement. “These programmes not only strengthen national security, but also support thousands of skilled jobs and generate significant export value for the UK economy,” BAE Systems Chief Executive Charles Woodburn said. BAE Systems said it remains committed to its capital allocation strategy, including continued investment in technology, selective acquisitions, and shareholder returns — totaling around 1.5 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) in 2025 through dividends and share buybacks. BAE Systems’ contracts this year span aviation, naval, ground, and electronic systems. Among the most notable awards is a four-billion euro contract to build 20 Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft and integrate weapons systems for Turkey, with deliveries expected to begin in 2030. In the US,

  The U.S. Air Force has released details of a $145 million contract action to develop and integrate an Air-to-Air Dual Mode weapon based on the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System. The effort is designed to counter large groups of unmanned aerial systems, particularly lower-cost Group 3 drones. According to a Justification and Approval document published February 13, 2026, the program supports a Joint Urgent Operational Need issued by combatant commanders in August 2024. The requirement was driven by what officials described as “growing risks from mass attacks involving lower-cost Group 3 drones, potentially numbering in the hundreds,” especially within the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. The program centers on upgrading the AGR-20F APKWS rocket, also known as FALCO, to create prototype air-to-air rounds. The new configuration adds a nose-mounted Long Wave Infrared seeker, a mid-body warhead, and a dual safe proximity fuze intended to defeat Group 3 unmanned aerial system threats. According to the document, the design allows a handoff from laser designation to infrared homing, reducing the time aircrews must maintain laser contact with a target. The Air Force stated that “the modification minimizes exposure during engagements while allowing faster targeting cycles against multiple airborne threats,” while keeping

  BAE Systems attracted record orders in 2025, and now the UK defense staple is setting its sights on years of growth amid a global ramp-up in spending. Its shares rose 3.6% on Wednesday after its full-year earnings report showed sales soared 10% last year to reach a record £30.7 billion ($41.7 billion). That helped push operating profits to £2.93 billion, a 9% year-on-year increase, as revenues grew 8% to £28.3 billion. The FTSE 100 -listed company, which manufactures a range of aircraft, weapons, munitions and warships, saw its order backlog hit £83.6 billion, a £5.8 billion increase from 2024. Now, BAE is preparing to capitalize on years of future growth as geopolitical fissures usher in what CEO Charles Woodburn called a "new era of defense spending" driven by "escalating security challenges." The company expects sales to grow by between 7% and 9% in 2026, with guidance for cumulative free cash flow between 2026 and 2028 in excess of £6 billion. "We're well positioned to provide both the advanced conventional systems and disruptive technologies needed to protect the nations we serve now and into the future," Woodburn said in a statement accompanying Wednesday's earnings.

  (RTTNews) - The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has awarded BAE Systems' FAST Labs research, development, and production organization a $16 million Phase 2 contract for the Oversight program. This initiative is focused on developing an autonomous system capable of maintaining constant "custody" of a large number of terrestrial assets through advanced satellite constellations. The award follows the successful completion of Phase 1, during which BAE Systems' software was integrated into a modeling and simulation environment to demonstrate custody missions using representative satellite and sensor models. In Phase 2, the company will further mature its solution algorithms and showcase operations with larger constellations, more complex scenarios, and higher fidelity modeling and simulation environments. The technology will be deployed across both tactical-edge satellites and ground stations. By deploying Oversight program software and algorithms on proliferated, networked satellite constellations, BAE Systems aims to enable persistent surveillance at tactical timescales. Space-based coordination and data processing will deliver lower latency and higher revisit rates, supporting near real-time tracking. This increased scale, availability, and timeliness of information will enhance warfighter situational awareness and accelerate decision-making. Work on the program will be conducted at BAE Systems' facilities in Burlington, Massachusetts, and Merrimack, New Hampshire,

  (RTTNews) - The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has awarded BAE Systems' FAST Labs research, development, and production organization a $16 million Phase 2 contract for the Oversight program. This initiative is focused on developing an autonomous system capable of maintaining constant "custody" of a large number of terrestrial assets through advanced satellite constellations. The award follows the successful completion of Phase 1, during which BAE Systems' software was integrated into a modeling and simulation environment to demonstrate custody missions using representative satellite and sensor models. In Phase 2, the company will further mature its solution algorithms and showcase operations with larger constellations, more complex scenarios, and higher fidelity modeling and simulation environments. The technology will be deployed across both tactical-edge satellites and ground stations. By deploying Oversight program software and algorithms on proliferated, networked satellite constellations, BAE Systems aims to enable persistent surveillance at tactical timescales. Space-based coordination and data processing will deliver lower latency and higher revisit rates, supporting near real-time tracking. This increased scale, availability, and timeliness of information will enhance warfighter situational awareness and accelerate decision-making. Work on the program will be conducted at BAE Systems' facilities in Burlington, Massachusetts, and Merrimack, New Hampshire,
