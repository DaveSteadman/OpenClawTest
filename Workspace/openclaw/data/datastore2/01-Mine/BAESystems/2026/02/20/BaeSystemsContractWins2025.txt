  BAE Systems has already won more than 27 billion pounds ($35 billion) in contracts in 2025, reflecting strong global demand for its defense platforms and technologies. Trading in the second half of the year has remained in line with expectations, the company said in a market update . It noted that operational performance “continues to be strong” as it delivers critical capabilities across combat aircraft, submarines, missile systems, and electronic warfare. The surge in contracts highlights the continuing impact of rising defense budgets and NATO modernization programs on global procurement. “These programmes not only strengthen national security, but also support thousands of skilled jobs and generate significant export value for the UK economy,” BAE Systems Chief Executive Charles Woodburn said. BAE Systems said it remains committed to its capital allocation strategy, including continued investment in technology, selective acquisitions, and shareholder returns — totaling around 1.5 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) in 2025 through dividends and share buybacks. BAE Systems’ contracts this year span aviation, naval, ground, and electronic systems. Among the most notable awards is a four-billion euro contract to build 20 Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft and integrate weapons systems for Turkey, with deliveries expected to begin in 2030. In the US,

  BAE Systems has announced its full year results for 2025, reporting record sales and a strengthened order backlog. The company said the performance reflects strong operational and financial delivery, supported by continued investment and rising global defence spending. Sales increased by 10% to a record £30.7 billion, with growth across all sectors and organic growth of 9%. Underlying EBIT rose by 12%, with return on sales increasing from 10.6% to 10.8%, while underlying earnings per share also grew by 12%. Free cash flow reached £2,158 million, with significant customer advances received late in the year. Capital expenditure remained close to record levels at around £1bn and research and development spending increased. The order backlog grew by £5.8 billion to a record £83.6 billion, with order intake of £36.8 billion across all sectors. The company said this reflects the continued relevance of its geographic footprint and multi-domain capabilities. Under IFRS measures, revenue growth of 8% reflected strong operational sales performance but excluded the impact of equity accounted investments. Operating profit increased by 9%, as growth in underlying EBIT was partly offset by amortisation costs linked to prior year acquisitions, including Ball Aerospace, while basic earnings per share rose by 6%.

  The defence giant, which employs around 12,000 people at its Warton and Samlesbury sites, said the success was underpinned by the ongoing progress of its combat air programmes. In 2025, the company secured Typhoon production into the next decade through a new agreement with the Republic of Turkiye and the UK Government to supply 20 aircraft. Additional orders include £800 million in contracts for major units on Typhoon aircraft for Germany and Italy. It saw revenue rise eight per cent to £28.3 billion, while operating profit is up to £2.9 billion, a nine per cent increase, and earnings before tax and interest up to £3.3bn, a 12 per cent jump.
